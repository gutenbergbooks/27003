<h3>OUR SHAKSPEARIAN CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p>We have received from a valued and kind correspondent (not one of
  those emphatically good-natured friends so wittily described by Sheridan)
  the following temperate remonstrance against the tone which has
  distinguished several of our recent articles on Shakspeare:&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Shakspeare Suggestions</i> (Vol. viii., pp. 124. 169.).&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Most busy, when least I do."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>I am grateful to A. E. B. for referring me to the article on
  "Shakspeare Criticism" in the last number of <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>.
  It is a very able paper, and worthy of general attention.</p>

  <p>I ought to add some few explanatory observations upon the subject of
  my former communication, but the tone of A.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B.'s comments forbids me
  to proceed with the discussion; the more especially as my suggestion has
  been made a reason for introducing into your pages comments which seem to
  me to be altogether unwarrantable upon other portions of the article in
  Blackwood. Whoever may be the writer of that article&mdash;I do not
  know&mdash;he needs no other defence than a reference to his paper. It is
  not on his account that I venture to allude to this subject; it is rather
  on yours, Mr. Editor, and with a view to the welfare of your paper. I
  cannot think that you or it will be benefited by converting
  conversational gossip about Shakspeare difficulties into "a duel in the
  form of a debate," seasoned with sarcasm, insinuation, and satiric point.
  This is not the kind of matter one expects to find in "N. &amp; Q."
  neither do I think your pages should be made a vehicle for "showing up"
  such of "the herd of menstrual Aristarchi" as chance to differ in opinion
  from some of your smart and peremptory, but not unfrequently inaccurate
  and illiberal correspondents.</p>

  <p>I know that you yourself are in this respect much in the power of your
  contributors. Probably you were as ignorant of the existence of the
  article in Blackwood as I was.<a name="footnotetag1"
  href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> It is now brought <!-- Page 262
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page262"></a>{262}</span>before your
  notice, and I invite you to look at it, and judge for yourself whether
  A.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B. has treated you, your paper, or the writer of that very
  excellent article, with common fairness in the remarks to which I
  allude.</p>

  <p>I make these observations on two grounds: first, as one who has many
  reasons for being anxious for the prosperity of "N. &amp; Q.;" and
  secondly, because I know it to be the opinion of several of your earliest
  and warmest friends, that there is a tendency in some of your Shakspeare
  contributors to indulge in insinuation, imputation of motives, and many
  other things which ought never to appear in your pages. We lately
  observed, with deep regret, that you were misled (not by A.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B.) into
  the insertion of unjustifiable insinuations, levelled against a gentleman
  whom we all know to be a man of the highest personal honour.</p>

  <p>The questions which are mooted in your pages ought to be discussed
  with the mutual forbearance and enlarged liberality which are predominant
  in the general society of our metropolis; not with the keen and angry
  partizanship which distinguishes the petty squabbles of a country
  town.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Icon</span>.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>Our readers know that we ourselves recently noticed the tendency of
  too many of our correspondents to depart from the courteous spirit by
  which the earlier communications to this Journal were distinguished. The
  intention we then announced of playing the tyrant in future, and
  exercising with greater freedom our "editorial privilege of omission," we
  now repeat yet more emphatically. <span class="sc">Icon</span> well
  remarks that we are much in the power of our contributors. Indeed we are
  more so than even he supposes.</p>

  <p>An article on the <i>Notes and Emendations</i> which lately appeared
  in our columns concluded, in its original form, with an argument against
  their genuineness, based on the use of a word unknown to Shakspeare and
  his cotemporaries. This appeared to us somewhat extraordinary, and a
  reference to Richardson's excellent Dictionary proved that our
  correspondent was altogether wrong <i>as to his facts</i>. We of course
  omitted the passage; but we ought not to have received a statement
  founded on a mistake which might have been avoided by a single reference
  to so common a book.</p>

  <p>Again, at p. 194. of the present volume, another correspondent, after
  pointing out some coincidences between the old Emendator and some
  suggested corrections by Z. Jackson, and stating that <span
  class="sc">Mr. Collier</span> never once refers to Jackson, proceeds:
  "<span class="sc">Mr. Singer</span>, however, talks familiarly about
  Jackson, in his <i>Shakspeare Vindicated</i>, as if he had him at his
  fingers' ends; and yet, at p. 239., he favours the world with an
  <i>original</i> emendation (viz. 'He did <i>behood</i> his anger,'
  <i>Timon</i>, Act III. Sc. 1.), which, however, will be found at page
  389. of Jackson's book." Now, after this, who would have supposed that,
  as we learn from <span class="sc">Mr. Singer</span>, "<span
  class="sc">Mr. Ingleby</span> has founded his charge on such slender
  grounds as one cursory notice of Jackson at p. 288. of my book, where I
  mentioned him merely on the authority of <span class="sc">Mr.
  Collier</span>." And who that knows <span class="sc">Mr. Singer</span>
  will doubt the truth of his assertion, that he has not even seen
  Jackson's book for near a quarter of a century, and that he had not the
  slightest reason to doubt that the conjecture of <i>behood</i> for
  <i>behave</i> was his own property?<a name="footnotetag2"
  href="#footnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

  <p>But there is another gentleman who, although he has never whispered a
  remonstrance to us upon the subject, has even more grounds of complaint
  than <span class="sc">Mr. Singer</span>, for the treatment which he has
  received in our columns; we mean our valued friend and contributor <span
  class="sc">Mr. Collier</span>, who we feel has received some injustice in
  our pages. But the fact is that, holding, as we do unchanged, the opinion
  which we originally expressed of the great value of the <i>Notes and
  Emendations</i>&mdash;knowing <span class="sc">Mr. Collier's</span>
  character to be above suspicion&mdash;and believing that the result of
  all the discussions to which the <i>Notes and Emendations</i> have given
  rise, will eventually be to satisfy the world of their great
  value,&mdash;<i>we</i> have not looked so strictly as we ought to have
  done, and as we shall do in future, to the tone in which they have been
  discussed in "N. &amp; Q."</p>

  <p>And here let us take the opportunity of offering a few suggestions
  which we think worthy of being borne in mind in all discussions on the
  text of Shakspeare, whether the object under consideration be what
  Shakspeare actually wrote, or what Shakspeare really meant by what he did
  write.</p>

  <p>First, as to this latter point. Some years ago a distinguished
  scholar, when engaged in translating Göthe's <i>Faust</i>, came to a
  passage involved in considerable obscurity, and which he found was
  interpreted very differently by different admirers of the poem. Unable,
  under these circumstances, to procure any satisfactory solution of the
  poet's meaning, the translator applied to Göthe himself, and received
  from him the candid reply which we think it far from improbable that
  Shakspeare himself might give with reference to many passages in his own
  writings,&mdash;"That <!-- Page 263 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page263"></a>{263}</span>he was very sorry he could not assist him,
  but he really did not know exactly what he meant when he wrote it." We
  doubt not some of our contributors could supply us with many similar
  avowals.</p>

  <p>This opinion will no doubt offend many of those blind worshippers of
  Shakspeare, who will not believe that he could have written a passage
  which is not perfect, and who, consequently, will not be satisfied with
  any note, emendation, or restoration which does not make the passage into
  which it is introduced "one entire and perfect chrysolite." But this is
  unreasonable. We have direct evidence of the imperfect character of much
  that Shakspeare wrote. When told that Shakspeare had never blotted a
  line, Ben Jonson&mdash;no mean critic, and no unfriendly one&mdash;wished
  he had "blotted a thousand." Would rare Ben have uttered such a wish
  ignorantly and without cause? We believe the existence of such defects in
  the writings of Shakspeare, as they were left by him. It follows,
  therefore, that in our opinion Shakspeare is under great obligations to
  the undeservedly-abused commentators.<a name="footnotetag3"
  href="#footnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> It would be strange indeed, when we
  consider how many men of genius and learning have busied themselves to
  illustrate his writings, if none of them should have caught any
  inspiration from his genius. We believe they have done so. We believe
  Theobald's "babbled o' green fields" to be one of many instances in
  which, with reference to some one particular passage, the scholiast has
  proved himself worthy of and excelling his author. Yes, Shakspeare, the
  greatest of all uninspired writers, was but mortal; and his worshippers
  would sometimes do well bear in mind that their golden image had but feet
  of clay.</p>

  in many instances with readings which had been suggested many years

<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>MR. PEPYS AND EAST LONDON TOPOGRAPHY, ETC.</h3>

  <p>In "N. &amp; Q." (Vol. i., p. 141.) there appeared an article upon the
  Isle of Dogs, &amp;c., which spoke of the neglected topography of the
  east of London, and requested information on one or two points. Having
  felt much interested in this matter, I have endeavoured to obtain
  information by personal investigation, and send you the following from
  among a mass of Notes:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. <i>Isle of Dogs.</i> In a map drawn up in 1588 by Robert Adams,
  engraved in 1738, this name is applied to an islet in the river Thames,
  still in part existing, at the south-west corner of the peninsula. From
  this spot the name appears to have extended to the entire marsh.</p>

  <p>2. <i>Dick Shore</i>, Limehouse. This is now called <i>Duke Shore</i>,
  Fore Street. In Gascoyne's Map of Stepney, 1703, it is called <i>Dick
  Shoar</i>. Since that time <i>Dick</i> has become a <i>Duke</i>. Mr.
  Pepys would find boats there now if he visited the spot.</p>

  <p>3. Mr. Pepys, in his <i>Diary</i> of Mar. 23, 1660, speaks of "the
  great breach," near Limehouse. The spot now forming the entrance to the
  City Canal or South Dock of the West India Dock Company was called "the
  breach," when the canal was formed.</p>

  <p>4. July 31, 1665. Mr. Pepys speaks of the <i>Ferry</i> in the Isle of
  Dogs. This ferry is named as a horse-ferry by Norden in the <i>Britanniæ
  Speculum</i>, 1592 (MS.). The ferry is still used, but only seldom as a
  horse-ferry.</p>

  <p>5. Oct. 9, 1661. Mr. P. mentions Captain Marshe's, at Limehouse, close
  by the lime-house. There is still standing there a large old brick house,
  which may be the same; and the lime-kiln yet exists, for, as Norden says,
  "ther is a kiln contynually used."</p>

  <p>6. Sept. 22, 1665. Mr. P. speaks of a discovery made "in digging the
  late docke." This discovery consisted of nut trees, nuts, yew, ivy,
  &amp;c., twelve feet below the surface. Johnson no doubt told him the
  truth. The same discovery was made in 1789, in digging the Brunswick
  Dock, also at Blackwall, and elsewhere in the neighbourhood.</p>

  <p>This very week (Aug. 25, 1853) I procured specimens of several kinds
  of wood, with land and freshwater shells, from as great a depth in an
  excavation at the West India Docks; the wood from a bed of peat, the
  shells from a bed of clay resting upon it. There exists an ancient house
  at the dock which Mr. P. visited, and which is probably the same.</p>

  <p>Other illustrations of the <i>Diary</i> from this quarter might be
  adduced; let these, however, suffice as a specimen.</p>

  <p>It may probably be new to most of your readers, as it is to me, that
  an ancient house in Blackwall (opposite the Artichoke Tavern) is said to
  have been the residence of Sebastian Cabot at one time, and at another
  that of <i>Sir Walter Raleigh</i>. Whether the tradition be true or not,
  the house is very curious, and worth a visit, if not worthy of being
  sketched and engraved to preserve its memory. Perhaps the photograph in
  this case could be applied.</p>

  <p>It is not impossible that Sir John de Pulteney or Poultney, to whom
  the manor of Poplar was granted in the 24th of Edward III., resided on
  this spot. My reasons for thinking it are&mdash;this fact, which connects
  him with the neighbourhood; and the inference from two other facts, viz.
  that the house in which Sir John resided in town was <!-- Page 264
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page264"></a>{264}</span>called <i>Cold
  Harbour</i>, and that <i>Cold Harbour</i> is here also to be found. Sir
  John Pulteney is thus connected with both the places known by this
  name.</p>

  <p>I would give my name in verification, but you have it, as you should
  have the names and addresses of all your correspondents.</p>

<h3>PICTS' HOUSES IN ABERDEENSHIRE.</h3>

  <p>A short time ago, one of those remarkable remains of a very remote
  antiquity, and called by the country-people Picts' Houses, Yird, Eirde,
  or Erde houses, was discovered by Mr. Douglass, farmer, Culsh, in the
  parish of Tarland, Aberdeenshire, near his farm-steading, on the property
  of our noble Premier. It is a subterranean vault, of a form approaching
  the semicircular, but elongated at the farther end. Its extreme length is
  thirty-eight feet; its breadth at the entrance a little more than two
  feet, gradually widening towards the middle, where the width is about six
  feet, and it continues at about that average. The height is from five and
  a half to six feet. The sides are built with stones, some of them in the
  bottom very large; the roof is formed of large stones, six or seven feet
  long, and some of them weighing above a ton and a half. They must have
  been brought from the neighbouring hill of Saddle-lick, about two miles
  distant, being of a kind of granite not found nearer the spot. The floor
  is formed of the native rock (hornblende), and is very uneven. When
  discovered it was full of earth, and in the process of excavation there
  was found some wood ashes, fragments of a glass bottle, and an
  earthenware jar (modern), some small fragments of bones, and one or two
  teeth of a ruminant animal, and the upper stone of a querne
  (hand-corn-mill, mica schist), together with a small fragment, probably
  of the lower stone. But, alas! there were no hieroglyphics or cuneiform
  inscriptions to assist the antiquary in his researches. These underground
  excavations have been found in various parishes in Aberdeenshire, as well
  as in several of the neighbouring counties. In the parish of Old Deer,
  about fifty years ago, a whole village of them was come upon; and about
  the same time, in a den at the back of Stirlinghill, in the parish of
  Peterhead, one was discovered which contained some fragments of bones and
  several flint arrow-heads, and battle-axes in the various stages of
  manufacture. In no case, however, have any of those previously discovered
  been of the same magnitude as the one described above. They were
  generally of from twelve to fifteen feet in length, and from three to
  four feet in height, and some only six feet in length, so that this must
  have been in its day (when?) a rather aristocratic affair. Have any
  similar excavations been found in England? The earliest mention of the
  parish of Tarland, of which there is any account, is in a charter granted
  by Moregun, Earl of Mar, to the Canons of St. Andrews, of the Church of
  S. Machulnoche (S. Mochtens, Bishop and Confessor) of Tharuclund, with
  its tithes and oblations, its land and mill, and timber from the Earl's
  woods for the buildings of the canons, <span class="scac">A.D.</span>
  1165-71; and a charter of King William the Lion, and one of Eadward,
  Bishop of Aberdeen, both of same date, confirming the said grant.</p>

<h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>

  <p><i>Legends of the County Clare.</i>&mdash;How Fuen-Vic-Couil (Fingall)
  obtained the knowledge of future events.&mdash;Once upon a time, when
  Fuen-Vic-Couil was young, he fell into the hands of a giant, and was
  compelled to serve him for seven years, during which time the giant was
  fishing for the salmon which had this property&mdash;that whoever ate the
  first bit of it he would obtain the gift of prophecy; and during the
  seven years the only nourishment which the giant could take was after
  this manner: a sheaf of oats was placed to windward of him, and he held a
  needle before his mouth, and lived on the nourishment that was blown from
  the sheaf of corn through the eye of the needle. At length, when the
  seven years were passed, the giant's perseverance was rewarded, and he
  caught the famous salmon and gave it to Fuen-Vic-Couil to roast, with
  threats of instant destruction if he allowed any accident to happen to
  it. Fuen-Vic-Couil hung the fish before the fire by a string, but, like
  Alfred in a similar situation, being too much occupied with his own
  reflections, forgot to turn the fish, so that a blister rose on the side
  of it. Terrified at the probable consequences of his carelessness, he
  attempted to press down the blister with his thumb, and feeling the smart
  caused by the burning fish, by a natural action put the injured member
  into his mouth. A morsel of the fish adhered to his thumb, and
  immediately he received the knowledge for which the giant had toiled so
  long in vain. Knowing that his master would kill him if he remained, he
  fled, and was soon pursued by the giant breathing vengeance: the chace
  was long, but whenever he was in danger of being caught, his thumb used
  to pain him, and on putting it to his mouth he always obtained knowledge
  how to escape, until at last he succeeded in putting out the giant's eyes
  and killing him; and always afterwards, when in difficulty or danger, his
  thumb used to pain him, and on putting it to his mouth he obtained
  knowledge how to escape.</p>

  <p>Compare this legend with the legend of Ceridwen, Hanes Taliessin,
  <i>Mabinogion</i>, vol. iii. pp. 322, 323., the coincidence of which is
  very curious. Where also did Shakspeare get the <!-- Page 265 --><span

  the witches utter in <i>Macbeth</i>:</p>

  any running stream, and pass them separately through the mouth of the
  infant: then plunge the rushes again into the stream, and as the current
  bears them away, so will the thrush depart from the child."</p>

  <p>Should this, as is not unlikely, prove ineffectual, "Capture the
  nearest duck that can be met with, and place its mouth, wide open, within
  the mouth of the sufferer. The cold breath of the duck will be inhaled by
  the child, and the disease will gradually, and as I have been informed,
  not the less surely, take its departure."</p>

<h3>HERALDIC NOTES.</h3>

  <p><i>Arms of Granville.</i>&mdash;The meaning of the peculiar bearing
  which, since the thirteenth century, has appertained to this noble
  family, has always been a matter of uncertainty to heraldic writers: it
  has been variously blazoned as a clarion, clavicord, organ-rest,
  lance-rest, and sufflue. The majority of heralds, ancient and modern,
  term it a clarion without quite defining what a clarion is: that it is
  meant for a musical instrument (probably a kind of hand-organ), I have
  very little doubt; for, in the woodcut Mrs. Jameson gives in her
  <i>Legends of the Madonna</i> (p. 19.) of Piero Laurati's painting of the
  "Maria Coronata," the uppermost angel on the left is represented as
  carrying an instrument exactly similar to this charge as it is usually
  drawn. The date of this painting is 1340. This is probably about the date
  of the painted glass window in the choir of Tewkesbury Abbey Church,
  where Robert Earl of Gloucester bears three of these clarions on his
  surcoat; and upon a careful examination of these, I was convinced that
  they were intended to represent instruments similar to that carried by
  the angel in Laurati's painting.</p>

  <p><i>Arms of Richard, King of the Romans.</i>&mdash;This celebrated man,
  the second son of King John, Earl of Cornwall and Poictou, was elected
  King of the Romans at Frankfort on St. Hilary's Day (Jan. 13th) 1256. His
  earldom of Cornwall was represented by&mdash;Argent, a lion rampant gules
  crowned or; his earldom of Poictou by a bordure sable, bezantée, or
  rather of peas (<i>poix</i>) in reference to the name <i>Poictou</i>; and
  as king of the Romans he is said to have borne these arms upon the breast
  of the German double-headed eagle displayed sable, which represented that
  dignity. I do not recollect having seen them under this last form, but I
  have "made a Note of" several other variations I have met
  with:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. In Dorchester Church, Oxfordshire, in painted glass: Argent, a lion
  rampant, gules crowned or, within a bordure sable bezantée.</p>

  <p>2. On the seal of a charter granted by the earl to the monks of
  Okeburry: a lion rampant crowned. No bordure.</p>

  <p>3. On an encaustic tile in the old Singing-school at Worcester: A lion
  rampant <i>not</i> crowned, with a bordure bezantée. Another tile has the
  eagle, single-headed, displayed.</p>

  <p>4. Encaustic tiles at Woodperry, Oxfordshire: A row of tiles with the
  lion rampant, apparently within a bordure, but without the bezants;
  followed by another row which has the eagle displayed, but not
  double-headed.</p>

  <p>5. On an encaustic tile at Hailes Abbey, Gloucestershire, founded by
  him: The double-headed eagle only, <i>countercharged</i>.</p>

  <p>6. On a tile in the Priory Church of Great Malvern: The double-headed
  eagle displayed, within a circular bordure bezantée.</p>

  <p>7. On a tile which I have seen, but cannot just now recollect where:
  The double-headed eagle, bezantée, without any bordure.</p>

  <p>A curious instance of ex-officio arms added to the paternal coat,
  occurs on the monument of Dr. Samuel Blythe, at the east end of St.
  Edward's Church, Cambridge. He was Master of Clare Hall, and in this
  example his paternal arms&mdash;Argent, a chevron gules, between three
  lions rampant sable&mdash;occupy the lower part of the shield, being
  divided at the fess point by something like an inverted chevron, from the
  arms of Clare Hall, which thus occupy the upper half of the shield. The
  date is 1713. Is this way of dividing the arms a blunder of the
  painter's, or can any of your readers point out a similar instance?</p>

<h3>SHAKSPEARE CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>Difficulty of avoiding Coincident Suggestions on the Text of
  Shakspeare.</i>&mdash;A correspondent in Vol. viii., p. 193., is somewhat
  unnecessarily severe on <span class="sc">Mr. Collier</span> and <span
  class="sc">Mr. Singer</span>, for having overlooked some suggestions in
  Jackson's work: the enormous number of useless conjectures in that
  publication rendering it so tedious and unprofitable to consider them
  attentively, the student is apt to think his time better engaged in
  investigating other sources of information. I think, therefore, little of
  <span class="sc">Mr. Collier</span> overlooking the few coincident
  suggestions in Jackson, which are smaller in number than I had
  anticipated; the real cause for wonder consisting in the ignoring so many
  conjectures that have been treated of years ago, often at great length,
  by some of the <!-- Page 266 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page266"></a>{266}</span>most distinguished critics this country
  has produced. Generally speaking, however, there is in these matters such
  a tendency for reproduction, I should for one hesitate to accuse any
  critic of intentional unfairness, merely because he puts forth
  conjectures as new, when they have been previously published; and I have
  found so many of my own attempts at emendation, thought to be original,
  in other sources, that I now hesitate at introducing any as novel. These
  attempts, like most others, have only resulted occasionally in one that
  will bear the test of examination after it has been placed aside, and
  carefully considered when the impression of novelty has worn off. I think
  we may safely appeal to all critics who occupy themselves much with
  conjectural criticism, and ask them if <span class="sc">Time</span> does
  not frequently impair the complacency with which they regard their
  efforts on their first production.</p>

  <p>Vol. viii., p. 216., contains more instances of coincident
  suggestions, R.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;C. indulging in two conjectures, both supported very
  ably, but in the perfect unconsciousness that the first, <i>rude
  day's</i>, was long since mentioned by Mr. Dyce, in his <i>Remarks</i>,
  1844, p. 172., and that the second, the change of punctuation in <i>All's
  Well that Ends Well</i>, is the reading adopted by Theobald, and it is
  also introduced by Mr. Knight in the text of his "National Edition," p
  262., and has, I believe, been mentioned elsewhere. It may be said that
  this kind of repetition might be obviated by the publication of the
  various readings that have been suggested in the text of Shakspeare, but
  who is there to be found Quixotic enough to undertake so large and
  thankless a task, one which at best can only be most imperfectly
  executed: the materials being so scattered, and often so worthless, the
  compiler would, I imagine, abandon the design before he had made great
  progress in it. No fair comparison can be entertained in this respect
  between the text of Shakspeare and the texts of the classic authors. What
  has happened to R.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;C., happens, as I am about to show, to all who
  indulge in conjectural criticism.</p>

  <p>Any reader who will take a quantity of disputed passages in
  Shakspeare, and happens to be ignorant of what has been suggested by
  others, will discover that, in most of the cases, if he merely tries his
  skill on a few simple permutations of the letters, he will in one way or
  another stumble on the suggested words. Let us take, for example, what
  may be considered in its way as one of the most incomprehensible lines in
  Shakspeare&mdash;"Will you go, <i>An-heires</i>?" the last word being
  printed with a capital. Running down with the vowels from <i>a</i>, we
  get at once an apparently plausible suggestion, "Will you go <i>on
  here</i>?" but a little consideration will show how extremely unlikely
  this is to be the genuine reading, and that Mr. Dyce is correct in
  preferring <i>Mynheers</i>&mdash;a suggestion which belongs to Theobald,
  and not, as he mentions, to Hanmer. But what I maintain is, that <i>on
  here</i> would be the correction that would occur to most readers, in all
  probability to be at once dismissed. <span class="sc">Mr. Collier</span>,
  however, says "it is singular that nobody seems ever to have conjectured
  that <i>on here</i> might be concealed under <i>An-heires</i>;" and it
  would have been singular had this been the case, but the suggestion of
  <i>on here</i> is to be found in Theobald's common edition. Oddly enough,
  about a year before <span class="sc">Mr. Collier's</span> volume
  appeared, it was again suggested as if it were new.</p>

  <p>Let us select a still more palpable instance (<i>Measure for
  Measure</i>, Act II. Sc. 1.): "If this law hold in Vienna ten years, I'll
  rent the fairest house in it after threepence a <i>bay</i>." If this
  reading be wrong, which I do not admit, the second change in the first
  letter creates an obvious alteration, <i>day</i>, making at least some
  sort of sense, if not the correct one. Some years ago, I was rash enough
  to suggest <i>day</i>, not then observing the alteration was to be found
  in Pope's edition, and <span class="sc">Mr. Collier</span> has fallen
  into the same oversight, when he gives it as one of the corrector's new
  emendations. I regard these oversights as very pardonable, and
  inseparable from any extensive attempt to correct the state of the text.
  All Shakspearian conjectures either anticipate or are anticipated.</p>

  <p>Mr. Dyce being <i>par excellence</i> the most judicious verbal critic
  of the day, it will scarcely be thought egotistical to claim for myself
  the priority for one of his emendations&mdash;"<i>Avoid thee</i>,
  friend," in the <i>Few Notes</i>, p. 31., a reading I had mentioned in
  print before the appearance of that work. This is merely one of the many
  evidences that all verbal conjecturers must often stumble on the same
  suggestions. Even the MS. corrector's alteration of the passage is not
  new, it being found in Pope's and in several other editions of the last
  century; another circumstance that exhibits the great difficulty and
  danger of asserting a conjecture to be absolutely unknown.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">J. O. Halliwell</span></p>

  <p>P.S. The subject is, of course, capable of almost indefinite
  extension, but the above hasty notes will probably occupy as much space
  as you would be willing to spare for its consideration.</p>

  <p><i>Alcides' Shoes.</i>&mdash;There is merit, in my opinion, in
  elucidating, if it were only a single word in our great dramatist. Even
  the attempt, though mayhap a failure, is laudable. I therefore have made,
  and shall make, hit or miss, some efforts that way. For example, I now
  grapple with that very odd line&mdash;</p>

  class="pagenum"><a name="page267"></a>{267}</span>it is corrupt. Now it
  appears to me that the critic who proposed to read <i>shows</i>, came
  very near the truth, and would have hit it completely if he had retained
  <i>Alcides'</i>, for it is the genitive with <i>robe</i> understood. To
  explain:</p>

  <p>Austria has on him the "skin-coat" of C&oelig;ur-de-Lion, and Blanch
  cries,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"O! well did he become that lion's robe,</p>
      <p>That did disrobe the lion of that robe."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>"It lies," observes the Bastard,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"It lies as sightly on the back of him (<i>Austria</i>)</p>
      <p>As great Alcides' (<i>robe</i>) shows upon an ass:&mdash;</p>
      <p>But, ass, I'll take that burden from your back," &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Were it not that <i>doth</i> is the usual word in this play, I might
  be tempted to read <i>does</i>. In reading or acting, then, the
  <i>cæsura</i> should be made at <i>Alcides'</i>, with a slight pause to
  give the hearer time to supply <i>robe</i>. I need not say that the robe
  is the lion's skin, and that there is an allusion to the fable of the
  ass.</p>

  <p>Now to justify this reading. Our ancestors knew nothing of our mode of
  making genitives by turned commas. They formed the gen. sing., and nom.
  and gen. pl., by simply adding <i>s</i> to the nom. sing.; thus king made
  <i>kings</i>, <i>kings</i>, <i>kings</i> (not <i>king's</i>,
  <i>kings</i>, <i>kings'</i>), and the context gave the case. If the noun
  ended in <i>se</i>, <i>ce</i>, <i>she</i>, or <i>che</i>, the addition of
  <i>s</i> added a syllable, as <i>horses</i>, <i>princes</i>, &amp;c., but
  it was not always added. Shakspeare, for example, uses <i>Lucrece</i> and
  <i>cockatrice</i> as genitives. I find the first instances of such words
  as <i>James's</i>, &amp;c., about the middle of the seventeenth century,
  but I am not deeply read in old books, so it may have been used
  earlier.</p>

  <p>In foreign words like <i>Alcides</i>, no change ever took place; it
  was the same for all numbers and cases, and the explanation was left to
  the context. Here are a couple of examples from Shakspeare himself:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"My fortunes every way as fairly ranked&mdash;</p>
      <p>If not with vantage&mdash;as Demetrius."&mdash;<i>Midsummer Night's Dream</i>, Act I. Sc. 1.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"To Brutus, to Cassius. Burn all. Some to Decius house, and some to
  Cascas; some to Ligarius. Away! go!"&mdash;<i>Julius Cæsar</i>, Act III.
  Sc. 3.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>All here are genitives, as well as <i>Cascas</i>. If any doubt, Brutus
  and Cassius, we have just been told, "Are rid like madmen through the
  gates of Rome," so <i>they</i> could not be burned. I say now, <i>judicet
  lector</i>!</p>

  <p>I must not neglect to add that there was another mode of forming the
  genitive, namely, by the possessive pronoun, as <i>the king his
  palace</i>. "A fly that flew into my <i>mistress</i> her eye," is the
  title of one of Carew's poems.</p>

<h2>Minor Notes.</h2>

  <p><i>Longfellow's Poetical Works.</i>&mdash;One of the best printed
  editions of Longfellow's <i>Poetical Works</i> which has appeared in
  England is ushered in by "An Introductory Essay" by the Rev. G.
  Gilfillan, A.M. I had lived in hopes, through each successive edition,
  that either the good taste of the publishers would strike out the preface
  entirely, or the amended taste of its author curtail some of its
  redundancies. As neither has been the case, but the 4th edition of the
  book now lies before me, I beg to offer the following examples:</p>

  <p>1. Of Ancient History:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"His [Longfellow's] ornaments, unlike those of the <i>Sabine</i> maid,
  have not crushed him."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>2. Of Modern History&mdash;<i>Dickens a Poet</i>:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A prophet may wrap himself up in austere and mysterious solitude: a
  poet must come 'eating and drinking.' Thus came Shakspeare, Dryden,
  Burns, Scott, Göthe; and thus have come in our day, <i>Dickens</i>, Hood,
  and Longfellow."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Is the song of "The Ivy Green" in <i>Pickwick</i> sufficient to
  justify this appellation? I do not remember any other "Poem" by Charles
  Dickens.</p>

  <p>3. Of Metaphors. Out of sixteen pages it is difficult to make a
  selection, but the following are striking:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"If not a prophet, <i>torn by a secret burden, and uttering it</i> in
  wild tumultuous strains,... he has found inspiration ... in the legends
  of other lands, whose <i>native vein</i>, in itself exquisite, has been
  <i>highly cultivated</i> and <i>delicately cherished</i>."</p>

  <p>"Excelsion," we are told, "is one of those happy thoughts which seem
  to drop down, like fine days, from some serener region, or <i>like
  moultings of the celestial dove</i>, which <i>meet instantly the
  ideal</i> of all minds, <i>and run on afterwards</i>, and for ever, <i>in
  the current of the human heart</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Does not this almost come up to Lord Castlereagh's famous metaphor? It
  certainly goes beyond Mr. Gilfillan's own praise of Longfellow, whose
  sentiment is described as "never false, nor strained, nor mawkish. It is
  <i>always mild</i>,... and <i>sometimes</i> it <i>approaches the
  sublime</i>." Mr. G. goes one step farther.</p>

  <p><i>Sir Walter Raleigh.</i>&mdash;I find the following remonstrance in
  defence of this distinguished man, against the imputation of Hume, in a
  letter addressed by Dr. Parr to Charles Butler:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Why do you follow Hume in representing Raleigh as an infidel? For
  Heaven's sake, dear Sir, look to his preface to his <i>History of the
  World</i>; look at his <i>Letters</i>, in a little 18mo., and here, but
  here only, you will find a tract [entitled The Sceptic], which led Hume
  to talk of Raleigh as an unbeliever. It is an epitome of the principles
  of the old sceptics; and to me, who, like Dr. Clarke and Mr. Hume, am a
  reader <!-- Page 268 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page268"></a>{268}</span>of Sextus Empiricus, it is very
  intelligible. Indeed, Mr. Butler, it is a most ingenious performance. But
  mark me well: it is a mere <i>lusus ingenii</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Mr. Butler appends this note:</p>

  had read aloud the whole, with a small exception, of Sir Walter Raleigh's
  History."&mdash;Butler's <i>Reminiscences</i>, vol. ii. p. 232.</p>

<h3>SIR PHILIP WARWICK.</h3>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A Discourse of Government, as examined by Reason, Scripture, and the
  Law of the Land. Written in 1678, small 8vo.: London, 1694."</p>

  <p>"Memoirs of the Reign of King Charles I., &amp;c., 8vo.: London,
  1702."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>To one or the other of these publications there was prefixed a preface
  which, as giving offence to the government, was suppressed. I agree with
  Mr. Bindley, who says (writing to Mr. Granger),</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The account you have given in your books of the <i>suppressed
  preface</i> to Sir Philip Warwick's <i>Memoirs</i>, is an anecdote too
  curious not to make one wish it <i>authenticated</i>."&mdash;<i>Letters
  to Mr. Granger</i>, p. 389.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The statement of Granger is adopted also by the Edinburgh editor of
  the <i>Memoirs</i> in 1813 (query, Sir W. Scott?), who says in his
  preface,</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"These Memoirs were first published by the learned Dr. Thomas Smith, a
  nonjuring divine, distinguished by oriental learning, and his writings
  concerning the Greek Church. The learned editor added a preface so much
  marked by his political principles, that he was compelled to <i>alter and
  retrench it</i>, for fear of a prosecution at the instance of the
  crown."&mdash;<i>Preface</i>, p. ix.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>So far as concerns the <i>Memoirs</i>. But in a note prefixed to a
  copy of the <i>Discourse of Government</i>, now in the Bodleian among
  Malone's books, and in his handwriting, it is stated,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"This book was published by Dr. Thomas Smith, the learned writer
  concerning the Greek Church. The preface, not being agreeable to the
  Court at the time it was published (the 5th year of William III.), was
  suppressed by authority, but is found in this and a few other copies.
  Granger says (vol. iv. p. 60., vol. v. p. 267., new edit.) that this
  preface by Dr. Smith was prefixed to Sir P.&nbsp;W.'s <i>Memoirs of Charles
  I.</i>; but this is a mistake. Whether Smith was the editor of the
  <i>Memoirs</i> I know not.&mdash;<span class="sc">Edmond
  Malone</span>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The obnoxious preface is assigned to the <i>Discourse of
  Government</i> also, by a writer in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> for
  1790, p. 509., where is a portrait of Warwick, and a notice of his
  life.</p>

  <p>The Edinburgh editor of the <i>Memoirs</i> gives the <i>original
  preface</i> of that work, which presents nothing at which exception could
  be taken. But as my copy of the <i>Discourse</i> is one of the few which
  (according to Malone) retains the address of "the publisher to the
  reader," I transcribe the following passages, which perhaps will
  sufficiently explain the suppression in 1694:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"As to the disciples and followers of Buchanan, Hobbs and Milton, who
  have exceeded their masters in downright impudence, scurrility, and
  lying, and the new modellers of commonwealths, who, under a zealous
  pretence of securing the rights of a <i>fancied original contract</i>
  against the encroachments of monarchs, are sowing the seeds of eternal
  disagreements, confusions, <!-- Page 269 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page269"></a>{269}</span>and bloody wars throughout the world (for
  the influence of evil principles hath no bounds, but, like infectious
  air, spreads everywhere), the peaceable, sober, truly Christian, and
  Church-of-England doctrine contained in this book, so directly contrary
  to their furious, mad, unchristian, and fanatical maxims, it cannot
  otherwise be expected but that they will soon be alarmed, and betake
  themselves to their usual arts of slander and reviling, and grow very
  fierce and clamorous upon it. Whatever shall happen," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Subsequently the author is spoken of as</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A gentlemen of sincere piety, of strict morals, of a great and vast
  understanding, and of a very solid judgement; a true son of the Church of
  England, and <i>consequently a zealous asserter and defender of the truly
  Christian and apostolical doctrine of non-resistance</i>; always loyal
  and faithful to the king his master in the worst of times," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>After these specimens, there will be little difficulty, I think, in
  determining that Granger was mistaken in describing the preface to the
  <i>Memoirs</i> as that which was suppressed, and that it was the
  publisher's "address to the reader" of the <i>Discourse</i> which
  incurred that sentence. Dr. Thomas Smith appears to have edited both
  works; and in the same address informs us of other works of Warwick
  in</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Divinity, philosophy, history, especially that of England, practical
  devotion, and the like. This I now publish [the <i>Discourse</i>] was
  written in the year 1678 (and designed as an appendix to his <i>Memoirs
  of the Reign of King Charles the First</i>, of most blessed memory, which
  hereafter may see the light, when more auspicious times shall encourage
  and favour the publication), which he, being very exact and curious in
  his compositions, did often refine upon," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It may be well to inquire whether any of these theological or
  philosophical lucubrations are yet extant. Was Sir Philip connected at
  all with Dr. Smith, or was he descended from Arthur Warwick, author of
  <i>Spare Minutes</i>?</p>

<h3>SEALS OF THE BOROUGH OF GREAT YARMOUTH.</h3>

  <p>I shall be exceedingly obliged by any explanatory remarks on the
  following list of seals:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. Oval (size 2.1 in. by 1.3). The angel Gabriel kneeling before a
  standing figure of the Virgin, and holding a scroll, on which is
  inscribed <span class="scac">AVE MARIA</span>. Legend:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  IER * NE * NACH.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Yarmouth was anciently called Gernemutha, or Iernemutha; and Ives
  attributes this seal to Yarmouth, though both the legend and the
  workmanship have a decidedly foreign appearance.</p>

  <p>Can any more satisfactory locality be assigned it?</p>

  <p>2. Circular (1 in. in diameter). Three fishes naiant (the arms of
  Yarmouth), within a bordure of six cusps. Legend:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>SAAL D' ASAI D' GRANT GARNAMVT.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Workmanship of about the fourteenth century; use unknown; but it has
  been employed for sealing burgess letters for many years past, until
  1847.</p>

  <p>Can it have reference to the staple? (Vid. Statutes at Large, Anne; 27
  Ed. III. stat. 2.; 43 Ed. III. cap. 1.; 14 Ric. II. cap. 1.)</p>

  <p>3. Circular (size 1.1 in. diameter). On an escutcheon a herring
  hauriant; the only instance of this bearing in connection with Yarmouth.
  Legend:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p><b>S. offic : corrotulat : í : nove : Iernmuth.</b></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Of this seal nothing whatever is known. Its workmanship is of the
  fifteenth century. The suggested extension of the legend is "Sigillum
  officii contrarotulatoris"&mdash;in nova Jernemutha, or in <i>nave</i>
  Jernemuthe. But was Yarmouth ever called <i>nova Gernemutha</i>? or what
  was the office alluded to?</p>

  <p><i>"I put a spoke in his wheel."</i>&mdash;What is the meaning of the
  phrase, "I put a spoke in his wheel?"</p>

  <p>In April last, a petition was heard in the Rolls Court on the part of
  the trustees of Manchester New College, praying that they might be
  allowed to remove that institution to London; and a single trustee was
  heard against such removal. One of the friends of the college was on this
  occasion heard to remark, "the removal to London was going on very
  smoothly, and it would have been done by this time, if this one trustee
  had not <i>put his spoke in the wheel</i>:" meaning, that the
  conscientious scruple of this trustee was the sole <i>impediment to the
  movement</i>. Is this the <i>customary</i> and proper mode of using the
  phrase; and, if so, how can putting a spoke to a wheel impede its
  motion?</p>

  <p>On the other hand, having heard some persons say that they had always
  understood the phrase to denote affording <i>help</i> to an undertaking,
  and confidently allege that this must be the <i>older</i> and <!-- Page
  270 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page270"></a>{270}</span>more
  correct usage, for "what," say they, "is a wheel without spokes?" I
  inquired of an intelligent lady, of long American descent, in what way
  she had been accustomed to hear the phrase employed, and the answer was
  "Certainly as a help: we used to say to one who had anything in hand of
  difficult accomplishment, 'Do not be faint-hearted, I'll give you a
  spoke.'"</p>

  <p>Dr. Johnson, in the folio edition of his <i>Dictionary</i>, 1755,
  after defining a spoke to be the "bar of a wheel that passes from the
  nave to the felly," cites:</p>

  <i>Pictorial History of England</i>, p. 270., it is stated
  that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Martin skins are mentioned in <i>Domesday Book</i> among the
  commodities brought by sea to Chester; and this appears from other
  authorities to have been one of the exports in ancient times from
  Ireland. Notices are also found of merchants from Ireland <i>landing at
  Cambridge</i> with cloths, and exposing their merchandise to sale."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The authority quoted for this statement is Turner, vol. iii. p.
  113.</p>

  <p>On referring to Turner's <i>Anglo-Saxons</i>, I find it stated:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"We read of merchants from Ireland <i>landing at Cambridge</i> with
  cloths, and exposing their merchandise to sale."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Mr. Turner refers to Gale, vol. ii. p. 482.</p>

  <p>I do not know to what work Mr. Turner refers, unless to Gale's
  <i>Rerum Anglicarum Scriptores <!-- Page 271 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page271"></a>{271}</span>Veteres</i>; on examining this I can find
  no passage at the page and volume indicated, on the subject.</p>

  <p>Can any of your readers state where it is to be found? It appears
  remarkable that the merchants from Ireland should land at the inland town
  of Cambridge, and it seems a probable conjecture that Cambridge is a
  mistake for Cambria.</p>

  <p>William of Malmesbury speaks of a commerce between Ireland and the
  neighbourhood of Chester, and it seems much more probable that the
  merchants of Ireland landed in Wales than in Cambridge.</p>

  <p><i>Derivation of Celt.</i>&mdash;What is the proper derivation of the
  word <i>celt</i>, as applied to certain weapons of antiquity? A good
  authority, in Dr. Smith's <i>Dictionary of Greek and Roman
  Antiquities</i>, p. 351., obtains the term from&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Celtes, an old Latin word for a chisel, probably derived from cælo,
  to engrave."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Mr. Wright (<i>The Celt, Roman, and Saxon</i>, p. 73.) says that
  Hearne first applied the word to such implements in <i>bronze</i>,
  believing them to be "Roman <i>celtes</i> or chisels;" and
  that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Subsequent writers, ascribing these instruments to the Britons, have
  retained the name, forgetting its origin, and have applied it
  indiscriminately, not only to other implements of bronze, but even to the
  analogous instruments of <i>stone</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And he objects to the term "as too generally implying that things to
  which it is applied are Celtic." On the other hand, Dr. Wilson
  (<i>Prehistoric Annals</i>, p. 129.) prefers to retain the word, inasmuch
  as the Welsh etymologists, Owen and Spurrell, furnish an ancient
  Cambro-British word <i>celt</i>, a flint stone. M. Worsaae (<i>Primeval
  Antiq.</i>, p. 26.) confines the term to those instruments of bronze
  which have a hollow socket to receive a wooden handle; the other forms
  being called paalstabs on the Continent. It seems clear that there is no
  connexion between this word and the name of the nation (<i>Celtæ</i>);
  but its true origin may perhaps be elicited by a little discussion in the
  pages of "N. &amp; Q."</p>

  <p><i>Ancient Superstition against the King of England entering or even
  beholding the Town of Leicester.</i>&mdash;The existence of a
  superstition to this effect is recorded in Rishanger's <i>Chronicle</i>,
  and also, as I am informed, in that of Thomas Wikes; but this I have not
  at present an opportunity of consulting.</p>

  <p>Rishanger's words are:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Rex [Henricus III.] autem, capta Norhamptun., Leycestr. tendens, in
  ea hospitatus est, quam nullus regni præter eum etiam videre,
  prohibentibus quibusdam superstitiose, præsumpsit."&mdash;P. 26.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It is also mentioned by Matthew of Westminster. (Vide Bohn's edition,
  vol. ii. p. 412.) The statement, that no king before Henry III. had
  entered the town, is however incorrect, as William the Conqueror and King
  John are instances to the contrary.</p>

  <p>Can any of your correspondents explain the origin of this
  superstition, or favour me with any farther notices respecting it?</p>

  <p>It is not unworthy of observation that very many of the royal
  personages who have visited Leicester, have been either unfortunate in
  their lives, or have met with tragical deaths.</p>

  <p>We may, however, hope, for the credit of the town, that their
  misfortunes may be attributed to other causes, rather than to their
  presence within its time-hallowed walls.</p>

  management of the Camera Lucida. I have one made by King of Bristol, and
  purchased about thirty years ago: it draws out, like a telescope, in
  three pieces, each six inches long; and at full length will give a
  picture of the dimensions of twenty inches by twelve. The upper piece is
  marked from above downwards, thus: at two inches below the lens, "2;" at
  an inch below that point, "3;" at half an inch lower, "4;" at half an
  inch lower still, "5;" half an inch below the point "5," a "7" is marked;
  and half an inch below the "7," there is a "10;" at seven-eighths below
  this last, "D" is marked. What reference have these nicely graduated
  points to the distance of an object from the instrument? Do the figures
  merely determine the size of the picture to be taken? How is one to be
  guided in their use and application to practice?</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Balliolensis</span>.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[The ground of offence for burning the <i>Historia Anglo-Scotica</i>
  is stated in <i>The Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland</i>, vol. xi. p.
  66., viz.: "Ordered, that a book published by the title of <i>Historia
  Anglo-Scotica</i>, by James Drake, M.D., and dedicated to Sir Edward
  Symour containing many false and injurious reflections upon the
  sovereignty and independence of this crown and nation, be burnt by the
  hand of the common hangman at the mercat Cross of Edinburgh, at eleven
  o'clock to-morrow (July 1, 1703), and the magistrates of Edinburgh
  appointed to see the order punctually executed." It would appear from the
  dedication prefixed to this work, that Drake merely pretended to edit it,
  for he says, that "upon a diligent revisal, in order, if possible, to
  discover the name of the author, and the age of his writing, he found
  that it was written in, or at least not finished till, the time of
  Charles I." But he says nothing more of the MS., nor how it came into his
  hands. A notice of Dr. Drake is given in Chalmers's <i>Biographical
  Dictionary</i>, and in the preface to <i>The Memorial of the Church of
  England</i>, edit. 1711, which was also burnt by the common hangman in
  1705. See "N. &amp; Q.," Vol. iii., p. 519.]</p>

<h3>BOOKS CHAINED TO DESKS IN CHURCHES.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 93.)</p>

  <p>The authority for this ancient custom appears to be derived from an
  act of the Convocation which assembled in 1562. Strype informs us
  (<i>Annals</i>, vol. i. c. 27.) that at this Convocation the following
  injunctions were given:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"First, That a Catechism be set forth in Latin, which is already done
  by Mr. Dean of Paul's [Dean Nowell], and wanteth only viewing. Secondly,
  That certain Articles [the Thirty-nine Articles], containing the
  principal grounds of Christian religion, be set forth much like to such
  Articles as were set forth a little before the death of King Edward, of
  which Articles the most part may be used with additions and corrections
  as shall be thought convenient. Thirdly, That to these Articles also be
  adjoined the <i>Apology</i>, writ by Bishop Jewell, lately set forth
  after it, hath been once again revised and so augmented and corrected as
  occasion serveth. That these be joined in <i>one</i> book; and by common
  consent authorised as containing true doctrine, and be enjoined to be
  taught the youth in the Universities and grammar schools throughout the
  realm, and also in cathedral churches, and collegiate, and in private
  houses: and that whosoever shall preach, declare, write, or speak
  anything in derogation, depraving or despising of the said book, or any
  doctrine therein contained, and be thereof lawfully convicted before any
  ordinary, &amp;c., he shall be ordered as in case of heresy, or else
  shall be punished as is appointed for those that offend and speak against
  the Book of Common Prayer, set forth in the first year of the Queen's
  Majesty's reign that now is: that is to say, he shall for the first
  offence forfeit 100 marks; for the second offence, 400 marks; and for the
  third offence, all his goods and chattels, and shall suffer imprisonment
  during life."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It is probable that this book found a place in churches as affording a
  standard of orthodoxy easy of reference to congregations in times not
  sufficiently remote from the Reformation, to render the preaching of
  Romish doctrines unlikely. This, if the surmise be correct, would be
  emphatically to bring the officiating minister to book. In Prestwich
  Church, the desk yet remains, together with the "Book of Articles," bound
  up as prescribed with Jewel's <i>Apology</i> (black-letter, 1611), but
  the chain has disappeared. The neighbouring church of Bingley has also
  its desk, to which the chain is still attached; but the "Book of
  Articles" has given place to some more modern volume.</p>

<h3>EPITAPHS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii. <i>passim.</i>)</p>

  <p>A goodly collection of singular epitaphs has appeared in "N. &amp;
  Q."; but I believe it yet lacks <!-- Page 274 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page274"></a>{274}</span>a specimen of the following
  tomfoolery&mdash;an initial epitaph. Green, in his <i>History of
  Worcester</i>, gives the following inscription from a monument under the
  north-west window of St. Andrew's Church in that city:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i1hg3">"Short of Weight.</p>
      <p class="i2">H L T B O</p>
      <p class="i3">R W</p>
      <p class="i1">I H O A J R</p>
      <p>A D 1780 &nbsp; &nbsp; A 63."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Green adds the following explanation of this riddle:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In <i>full measure</i> it would have stood thus: 'Here Lieth The Body
  Of Richard Weston, In Hopes Of A Joyful Resurrection. Anno Domini 1780.
  Aged 63.'"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Richard Weston was a baker, and the "Short of weight" gives the clue
  to the nature of his dealings, and also to the right reading of the
  epitaph.</p>

  <p>The following is from Ombersley Churchyard, Worcestershire:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Sharp was her wit,</p>
      <p class="i1">Mild was her nature;</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>From the churchyard of Cofton Hackett, Worcestershire, are the two
  following:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Here lieth the body of John Galey, sen., in expectation of the Last
  Day. What sort of man he was that day will discover. He was clerk of this
  parish fifty-five years. He died in 1756, aged 75."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The next is also to a Galey. Your correspondent <span
  class="sc">Pictor</span> (Vol. viii., p. 98.) gives the same epitaph,
  slightly altered, as being at Wingfield, Suffolk:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Pope boldly asserts (some think the maxim odd),</p>
      <p>An honest man's the noblest work of <span class="sc">God</span>.</p>
      <p>If this assertion is from error clear,</p>
      <p>One of the noblest works of <span class="sc">God</span> lies here."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>From Alvechurch, Worcestershire; to a man and wife:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"He, an honest, good-natured, worthy man; she, as eminent for conjugal
  and maternal virtues during her marriage and widowhood, as she had been
  before for amiable delicacy of person and manners."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The following, which is probably not to be surpassed, appeared in one
  of the earliest numbers of <i>Household Words</i>. It is from the
  churchyard of Pewsey, Wiltshire:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Here lies the body of Lady O'Looney, great-niece of Burke, commonly
  called the Sublime. She was bland, passionate, and deeply religious:
  also, she painted in water-colours, and sent several pictures to the
  Exhibition. She was first cousin to Lady Jones: and of such is the
  kingdom of heaven."</p>

  <p>If epitaphs of recent date are admitted in "N. &amp; Q.," perhaps the

<h3>"UP, GUARDS, AND AT THEM!"</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. v., p. 426.; Vol. viii., pp. 111. 184.)</p>

  <p>The authority for the Duke of Wellington having used these words at
  the battle of Waterloo is Capt. Batty, of the Grenadier Guards, in a
  letter written a few days after the battle, published in Booth's
  <i>Battle of Waterloo</i>, and illustrated by George Jones, Esq., R.A.,
  who is believed to have superintended the whole publication. I append the
  extract:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Upon the cavalry being repulsed, the Duke himself ordered our second
  battalion to form line with the third battalion, and, after advancing to
  the brow of the hill, to lie down and shelter ourselves from the fire.
  Here we remained, I imagine, near an hour. It was now about seven
  o'clock. The French infantry had in vain been brought against our line
  and, as a last resource, Buonaparte resolved upon attacking our part of
  the position with his veteran Imperial Guard, promising them the plunder
  of Brussels. Their artillery and they advanced in solid column to where
  we lay. The Duke, who was riding behind us, watched their approach; and
  at length, when within a hundred yards of us, exclaimed 'Up, guards, and
  at them again!' Never was there a prouder moment than this for our
  country or ourselves," &amp;c.&mdash;Second Letter of Capt. Batty,
  Grenadier Guards, dated June 22, 1815, from the village of Gommignies;
  his First Letter being dated Bavay, June 21, 1815.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This circumstantial account, written so few days after the battle,
  detailing affirmatively the command to the guards as heard by one of
  themselves, will probably countervail the negative testimony of C. as
  derived from the Duke's want of recollection: as well as the "Goodly
  Botherby's" of <span class="sc">Mr. Cuthbert Bede</span>. As an instance
  of the Duke's impressions of the battle, I may add, that he stated that
  there was <i>no smoke</i>, though Mr. Jones told me, that when he was on
  the ground two days afterwards the smoke was still hanging over it.</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>Mr. Muller's Process.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Mr. Sisson</span>
  inquires for any one's experience in the use of the above formula, and I
  beg to say I remember when it was published I tried it, but gave it up.
  It is an excellent plan, but requires improvement. The following were my
  objections:</p>

  <p>If the objects are not well illuminated by the sun, the image is not
  sharp. The skies taken are singularly the reverse of the iodide-of-potash
  method, as they are almost transparent.</p>

  <p>The solutions of iron are a constant trouble by precipitating.</p>

  <p>It has the same disadvantages as other modes on paper from inequality
  in the strength of the image. The photographic <i>pons asinorum</i>
  appears however to be got over by the process, viz. taking the picture at
  once in the camera, and it is very possible that it can be made perfect.
  A small quantity of chromate of potash, about one grain to three ounces
  of solution of iodide of iron, gives a little more force to the
  picture.</p>

  <p>I find the nitrate of lead a very useful salt in iodizing paper. Six
  grains of the salt to the ounce of water, and tincture of iodine added
  till a pale yellow, will give additional sensitiveness to iodized paper,
  if the sheets are floated upon the solution. This will shorten the time
  in the camera nearly five minutes; but it requires care, as it is apt to
  solarize.</p>

  <p>A weak solution of iodide of iron has also the same effect, and, if
  blotted off at once, it will not blacken by the use of gallic acid.</p>

  <p><i>Stereoscopic Angles.</i>&mdash;When I last addressed you, I fancied
  I should set the stereoscopic-angle question at rest. It appears,
  however, that <span class="sc">Mr. G. Shadbolt</span> is unconvinced, and
  as I alone (to the best of my knowledge) have defined and solved the
  problem in relation to this subject, you will perhaps allow me to offer a
  few words in rejoinder to <span class="sc">Mr. S.'s</span> arguments
  which, had that gentleman thought more closely, would not have been
  advanced. This is also requisite, because, from their speciousness, they
  are likely to mislead such as take what they read for granted. <span
  class="sc">Mr. S.</span> says that when the stereographs are placed at
  the same distance from the eyes as the focal length of the lens, that 2¼
  inches is the best space for the cameras to be apart; and that were this
  space increased, the result would be as though the pictures were taken
  from models. To this I reply, that the only correct space for the cameras
  to be apart is 2½ inches (<i>i. e.</i> the space usually found to be from
  pupil to pupil of our eyes), and this under every circumstance; and that
  any departure from this must produce error. As to the model-like
  appearance, I cannot see the reason of <!-- Page 276 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page276"></a>{276}</span>it. Next <span
  class="sc">Mr. Shadbolt</span> says, and rightly, that when the pictures
  are seen from a less distance than the focal length of the lens, they
  appear to be increased in bulk. But the "obvious remedy" I pronounce to
  be wrong, as it must produce error. The remedy is nevertheless obvious,
  and consists in placing the stereographs at the same distance from the
  eyes as the focal length of the lens. But, if this cannot be done, it
  were surely better to submit to some trifling exaggeration than to
  absolute deformity and error. <span class="sc">Mr. S.</span> says also,
  that as we mainly judge of distance, &amp;c. by the convergence of the
  optic axis of our eyes (Query, How do persons with only one eye judge?),
  so, in short or medium distances, it were better to let the camera
  radiate from its centre to the principal object to be delineated. The
  result of this must be error, as the following illustration will show.
  Let the sitter (for it is especially recommended in portraits) hold
  before him, horizontally, and in parallelism with the picture, a ruler
  two feet long; and let planes parallel to the ruler pass through the
  sitter's ears, eyes, nose, &amp;c. The consequence would be that the
  ruler, and all the other planes parallel to it, would have two vanishing
  points, and all the features be erroneously rendered. This, to any one
  conversant with perspective, should suffice. But, as all are not
  acquainted with perspective, perhaps the following illustration may prove
  more convincing. Suppose an ass to stand facing the observer; a boy
  astride him, with a big drum placed before him. Now, under the treatment
  recommended by <span class="sc">Mr. G. Shadbolt</span>, both sides of the
  ass would be visible; both the boy's legs; and the drum would have two
  heads. This would be untrue, absurd, ridiculous, and quite as wonderful
  as Mr. Fenton's twelve-feet span view from across the Thames.</p>

  <p>Once more, and I shall have done with the present arguments of <span
  class="sc">Mr. G. Shadbolt</span>. He says that the two pictures should
  have exactly the same range of vision. This I deny: for, were it so,
  there would be no stereoscopic effect. Let the object be a column: it is
  evident that a tangent to the left side of the column from the right eye,
  could not extend so far to the left as a tangent to the left side of the
  column from the left eye, and <i>vice versâ</i>. And it is only by this
  difference in the two pictures (or, in other words, the range of vision)
  that our conceptions of solidity are created. This is not exactly the
  test to suit the views of <span class="sc">Mr. Shadbolt</span>, as I am
  quite aware; but I chose it for its simplicity, and because it will bear
  demonstration; and my desire has been to elicit truth, and not to
  perpetuate error.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, I beg to refer <span class="sc">Mr. G. Shadbolt</span>
  to my definition and solution of the stereoscopic problem&mdash;which I
  then said I <i>believed</i>&mdash;but which I now unhesitatingly
  <i>assert</i> to be correct.</p>

  <p><i>Ammonio-nitrate of Silver.</i>&mdash;The inability of your
  correspondent <span class="sc">Philo-pho</span>. to form the
  ammonio-nitrate of silver from a solution of nitrate of silver, which has
  been used to excite albumenized paper, is in all probability owing to the
  presence of a small quantity of nitrate of ammonia, which has been
  imparted to the solution by the paper.</p>

  <p>Salts of ammonia form, with those of silver, double salts, from which
  the oxide of silver is not precipitated by the alkalies.</p>

  <p>I cannot however explain how it was that the solution had lost none of
  its silver, for the paper could not in such case have been rendered
  sensitive.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">York Herald</span> states, that "Anthony Fitz-Herbert

  in 30 Henry VIII." Fitz-Herbert was never <i>Chief Justice</i>. He was
  made a judge of the Common Pleas in 1522; and so continued till his death
  at the time mentioned, 1538. During that period, the office of Chief
  Justice of the Common Pleas was successively held by Sir Thomas Brudenell

    </div>
  </div>
  <p><i>Hoera</i> (hurrah) and <i>hoezee</i> (huzza), then, in the opinion
  of Staring, and indeed of many others, have not the same origin. Some
  have derived <i>hoezee</i> from <i>haussé</i>, a French word of applause
  at the hoisting (Fr. <i>hausser</i>) of the admiral's flag. Bilderdijk
  derives it from Hussein, a famous Turkish warrior, whose memory is still
  celebrated. Dr. Brill says, "<i>hoezee</i> seems to be only another mode
  of pronouncing the German <i>juchhé</i>." Van Iperen thinks it taken from
  the Jewish shout, "Hosanna!" Siegenbeek finds "the origin of
  <i>hoezee</i> in the shout of encouragement, 'Hou zee!' (hold sea)." Dr.
  Jager cites a Flemish author, who says "that this cry ('hou zee,' in
  French, <i>tiens mer</i>) seems especially to belong to us; since it was
  formerly the custom of our seamen always 'zee te houden' (to keep the
  sea), and never to seek shelter from storms." Dr. Jager, however, thinks
  it rather doubtful "that our <i>hoezee</i> should come from 'hou zee,'
  especially since we find a like cry in other languages." In old French
  <i>huz</i> signified a cry, a shout; and the verb <i>huzzer</i>, or
  <i>hucher</i>, to cry, to shout; and in Dutch <i>husschen</i> had the
  same meaning.&mdash;From the <i>Navorscher</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Ladies' Arms borne in a Lozenge</i> (Vol. vii., p. 571. Vol. viii.,
  pp. 37. 83.).&mdash;As this question is still open, I forward you the
  translation of an article inserted by me in the first volume of the
  <i>Navorscher</i>. Lozenge-formed shields have not been always, nor
  exclusively, used by ladies; for, in a collection of arms from 1094 to
  1649 (see <i>Descriptive Catalogue of Impressions from Scottish
  Seals</i>, by Laing, Edinburgh) are many examples of ladies' arms, but
  not one in which the shield has any other form than that used at the time
  by men. In England, however, as early as the fourteenth century, the
  lozenge was sometimes used by ladies, though perhaps only by widows.
  Nisbet (<i>System of Heraldry</i>, ii. 35.) mentions a lozenge-formed
  seal of Johanna Beaufort, Queen Dowager of Scotland, attached to a
  parchment in 1439; while her arms, at an earlier period, were borne on a
  common shield (<i>Gent. Mag.</i>, April, 1851). In France the use of the
  lozenge for ladies was very general; yet in the great work of Flacchio
  (<i>Généalogie de la Maison de la Tour</i>) are found several hundred
  examples of ladies' arms on oval <!-- Page 278 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page278"></a>{278}</span>shields; and in
  <i>Vredii Genealogia comitum Flandriæ</i> (p. 130.), on shields rounded
  off below. On the other hand, lozenges have sometimes been used by men:
  for instance, on a seal of Ferdinand, Infant of Spain, in Vredius, l. c.
  p. 148.; also on a dollar of Count Maurice of Hanau, in Kohler's
  <i>Müntzbelustig</i>. 14. See again the arms of the Count of Sickingen,
  in Siebmacher, Suppl. xi. 2. So much for the use of the lozenge. Most
  explanations of its origin appear equally far-fetched. That of
  Menestrier, in his <i>Pratique des Armoires</i> (p. 14.), seems to me the
  least forced. He derives the French name <i>lozange</i> from the Dutch
  <i>lofzang</i>:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In Holland," he says, "the custom prevails every year, in May, to
  affix verses and <i>lofzangen</i> (songs of praise) in lozenge-formed
  tablets on the doors of newly-made magistrates. Young men hung such
  tablets on the doors of their sweethearts, or newly-married persons. Also
  on the death of distinguished persons, lozenge-shaped pieces of black
  cloth or velvet, with the arms, name, and date of the death of the
  deceased, were exhibited on the front of the house. And since <i>there is
  little to be said of women, except on their marriage or death, for this
  reason has it become customary on all occasions to use for them the
  lozenge-shaped shield</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In confirmation of this may be mentioned, that formerly <i>lozange</i>
  and <i>lozanger</i> were used in the French for <i>louange</i> and
  <i>louer</i>; of which Menestrier, in the above-quoted work (p. 431.),
  cites several instances.</p>

  <p>Besides the conjectures mentioned by H. C. K. and <span
  class="sc">Broctuna</span>, may be cited that of Laboureur: who finds
  both the form and the name in the Greek word <span title="oxugônios" class="grk"
  >&#x1F40;&xi;&upsilon;&gamma;&#x1F7D;&nu;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>
  (<i>ozenge</i> with the article, <i>l'ozenge</i>); and of Scaliger, who

  <p><i>Sir William Hankford</i> (Vol. ii., p. 161. &amp;c.).&mdash;Your
  learned correspondent <span class="sc">Mr. Edward Foss</span> proves
  satisfactorily that Sir W. Gascoigne was not retained in his office of
  Chief Justice by King Hen. V. But <span class="sc">Mr. Foss</span> seems
  to have overlooked entirely the Devonshire tradition, which represents
  Sir William <i>Hankford</i> (Gascoigne's successor) to be the judge who
  committed Prince Henry. Risdon (<i>v</i>. Bulkworthy, <i>Survey of
  Devon</i>, ed. 1811, p. 246.), after mentioning a chapel built by Sir W.
  Hankford, gives this account of the matter:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"This is that deserving judge, that did justice upon the king's son
  (afterwards King Henry V.), who, when he was yet prince, commanded him to
  free a servant of his, arraigned for felony at the king's bench bar;
  whereat the judge replied, he would not. Herewith the prince, enraged,
  essayed himself to enlarge the prisoner, but the judge forbad; insomuch
  as the prince in fury stept up to the bench, and gave the judge a blow on
  the face, who, nothing thereat daunted, told him boldly: 'If you will not
  obey your sovereign's laws, who shall obey you when you shall be king?
  Wherefore, in the king's (your father's) name, I command you prisoner to
  the king's bench.' Whereat the prince, abashed, departed to prison. When
  King Henry IV., his father, was advertised thereof (as fast flieth fame),
  after he had examined the circumstances of the matter, he rejoiced to
  have a son so obedient to his laws, and a judge of such integrity to
  administer justice without fear or favour of the person; but withal
  dismissed the prince from his place of president of the council, which he
  conferred on his second son."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Risdon makes no mention of Sir W. Hankford's being retained in office
  by King Henry V. But at p. 277., <i>v.</i> Monkleigh, he gives the
  traditional account of Hankford's death (anno 1422), which represents the
  judge, in doubt of his safety, and mistrusting the sequel of the matter,
  to have committed suicide by requiring his park-keeper to shoot at him
  when under the semblance of a poacher:</p>

  <p><i>Mauilies, Manillas</i> (Vol. vii., p. 533.).&mdash;W.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;S. will
  probably find some of the information which he asks for in <i>Two Essays
  on the Ring-Money of the Celtæ</i>, which were read in the year 1837 to
  the members of the Royal Irish Academy by Sir William Betham, and in some
  observations on these essays which are to be found in the <i>Gentleman's
  Magazine</i> of that year. During the years 1836, 1837, and 1838, there
  were made at Birmingham or the neighbourhood, and exported from Liverpool
  to the river Bonney in Africa, large quantities of <i>cast-iron</i>
  rings, in imitation of the <i>copper</i> rings known as "Manillas" or
  "African ring-money," then made at Bristol. A vessel from Liverpool,
  carrying out a considerable quantity of these cast-iron rings, was
  wrecked on the coast of Ireland in the summer of 1836. A few of them
  having fallen into the hands of Sir William Betham, he was led to write
  the <i>Essays</i> before mentioned. The making of these cast-iron rings
  has been discontinued since the year 1838, in consequence of the natives
  of Africa refusing to give anything in exchange for them. From inquiry
  which I made in Birmingham in the year 1839, I learnt that more than 250
  tons of these cast-iron rings had been made in that town and
  neighbourhood in the year 1838, for the African market. The captain of a
  vessel trading to Africa informed me in the same year that the Black
  Despot, who then ruled on the banks of the river Bonney, had threatened
  to mutilate, in a way which I will not describe, any one who should be
  detected in landing these counterfeit rings within his territories.</p>

  <p><i>The Use of the Hour-glass in Pulpits</i> (Vol. vii., p. 589.; Vol.
  viii., p. 82.).&mdash;Your correspondent A.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;S. having called attention
  to the use of the hour-glass in pulpits (Vol. vii., p. 589.), I beg to
  mention two instances in which I have seen the stands which formerly held
  them. The first is at Pilton Church, near Barnstaple, Devon, where it
  still (at least very lately it did) remain fixed to the pulpit; the other
  instance is at Tawstock Church (called, from its numerous and splendid
  monuments, the Westminster Abbey of North Devon), but here it has been
  displaced, and I saw it lying among fragments of old armour, banners,
  &amp;c., in a room above the vestry. They were similar in form, each
  representing a man's arm, cut out of sheet iron and gilded, the hand
  holding the stand; turning on a hinge at the shoulder it lay flat on the
  panels of the pulpit when not in use. When extended it would project
  about a yard.</p>

  <p><i>Derivation of the Word "Island"</i> (Vol. viii., p.
  209.).&mdash;Your correspondent C. gives me credit for a far greater
  amount of humour than I can honestly lay claim to. He appears (he must
  excuse me for saying so) to have scarcely read through my observations on
  the derivation of the word <i>island</i>, which he criticises so
  unmercifully; and to have understood very imperfectly what he has read.
  For instance, he says that my "derivation of <i>island</i> from
  <i>eye</i>, the visual orb, because each are (<i>sic</i>) surrounded by
  water, seems like banter," &amp;c. Had I insisted on any such analogy, I
  should indeed have laid myself open to the charge; but <i>I did nothing
  of the kind</i>, as he will find to be the case, if he will take the
  trouble of perusing what I wrote. My remarks went to show, that, in the
  A.-S. compounded terms, <i>Ealond</i>, <i>Igland</i>, &amp;c., from which
  our word <i>island</i> comes, the component <i>ea</i>, <i>ig</i>,
  &amp;c., does not mean <i>water</i>, as has hitherto been supposed to be
  the case, but an <i>eye</i>; and that on this supposition alone can the
  simple <i>ig</i>, used to express an <i>island</i>, be explained. Will C.
  endeavour to explain it in any other way?</p>

  <p>Throughout my remarks, the word <i>isle</i> is not mentioned. And why?
  Simply because it has no immediate etymological connexion with the word
  <i>island</i>, being merely the French word naturalised. The word
  <i>isle</i> is a simple, the word <i>island</i> a compound term. It is
  surely a fruitless task (as it certainly is unnecessary for any one, with
  the latter word ready formed to his hand in the Saxon branch of the
  Teutonic, and, from its very form, clearly of that family), to go out of
  his way to torture the Latin into yielding something utterly foreign to
  it. My belief is, that the resemblance between these two words is an
  accidental one; or, more properly, that it is a question whether the
  introduction of an <i>s</i> into the word <i>island</i> did not originate
  in the desire to assimilate the Saxon and French terms.</p>

  <p><i>A Cob-wall</i> (Vol. viii., p. 151.).&mdash;A "cob" is not an
  unusual word in the midland counties, meaning a lump or small hard mass
  of anything: it also means a blow; and a good "cobbing" is no unfamiliar
  expression to the generality of schoolboys. A "cob-wall," I imagine, is
  so called from its having been made of heavy lumps of clay, beaten one
  upon another into the form of a wall. I would ask, if "gob," used also in
  Devonshire for the stone of any fruit which contains a kernel, is not a
  cognate word?</p>

  <p><i>Oliver Cromwell's Portrait</i> (Vol. vi. <i>passim</i>).&mdash;In
  reference to this Query, the best portrait of Oliver Cromwell is in the
  Baptist College here, and 500 guineas have been refused for it.</p>

  <p>I am not aware if it is the one alluded to by your correspondents. The
  picture is small, and depicts the Protector <i>without</i> armour: it is
  by Cooper, and was left to its present possessors by the Rev. Andrew
  Gifford, a Baptist minister, in 1784.</p>

  <p>Two copies have been made of it, but the original has never been
  engraved; from one of the copies, however, an engraving is in process of
  execution, after the picture by Mr. Newenham, of "Cromwell dictating to
  Milton his letter to the Duke of Savoy." The likeness of Cromwell in this
  picture is taken from one of the copies.</p>

  <p>The original is not allowed to be taken from off the premises on any
  consideration, in consequence of a dishonest attempt having been made,
  some time ago, to substitute a copy for it.</p>

  <p><i>Manners of the Irish</i> (Vol. viii., pp. 5. 111.)&mdash;A slight

  <p>I take to mean "Thanks to God, God is good." In Gaelic the spelling
  would be&mdash;"is math in Dia." A Roman Catholic Celt would often hear
  his priest say "Deo Gratias."</p>

  <p>The meaning of the passage seems to be pretty clear, and may be
  rendered thus:&mdash;The Irish farmer, although in the abundant enjoyment
  of <!-- Page 280 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  were enjoying only those blessings of Providence to which he is justly
  entitled.</p>

  <p><i>Chronograms and Anagrams</i> (Vol. viii., p. 42.).&mdash;Perhaps

  <p>This title is followed by a dedication to S. Michael and an address to
  Ferdinand; after which come one hundred hexameters, <i>every one of which
  is a chronogram</i>, and each chronogram gives the same result, viz.

  married Catherine, the eldest daughter and co-heir of Thomas, Lord
  Wotton, and had issue one son Philip, and two daughters, Mary and
  Catherine. Lord Stanhope died s. p. Nov. 29, 1634. His widow was
  governess to the Princess of Orange, daughter of Charles I., and
  attending her into Holland, sent over money, arms, and ammunition to that
  king when he was distressed by his rebellious subjects. For such
  services, and by reason of her long attendance on the princess, she was,
  on the restoration of Charles II. (in regard that Lord Stanhope, her
  husband, did not live to enjoy his father's honours), by letters patent
  bearing date May 29, 12 Charles II., advanced to the dignity of Countess
  of Chesterfield for life, as also that her daughters should enjoy
  precedency as earl's daughters.</p>

  <p>She took to her second husband John Poliander Kirkhoven, Lord of
  Kirkhoven and Henfleet, by whom she had a son, <i>Charles Henry</i>
  Kirkhoven, the subject of the Query.</p>

  <p>This gentleman, chiefly on account of his mother's descent, was
  created a baron of this realm by the title of Lord Wotton of Wotton in
  Kent, by letters patent bearing date at St. Johnstone's (Perth) in
  Scotland, August 31, 1650, and in September, 1660, was naturalised by
  authority of parliament, together with his sisters. He was likewise in
  1677 created Earl of <i>Bellomont</i> in Ireland, and, dying without
  issue, left his estates to his nephew Charles Stanhope, the younger son
  of his half-brother the Earl of Chesterfield, who took the surname of
  Wotton.</p>

  of colour have been suggested by the sarcasms and jeers about "green
  bags," which were very current during the proceedings on the Bill of
  Pains and Penalties, commonly known as the <i>Trial</i> of Queen
  Caroline, some thirty years ago? The reports of the evidence collected by
  the commission on the Continent, was laid on the table in a <i>sealed

  outcry, that the lawyers may have deemed it prudent to strike their
  colours, and have recourse to some other less obnoxious to remark.</p>

  <p><i>The Botany of the Eastern Borders, with the Popular Names and Uses

  with them</i>, by George Johnson, M.D. This, the first volume of <i>The
  Natural History of the Eastern Borders</i>, is a book calculated to
  please a very large body of readers. The botanist will like it for the
  able manner in which the various plants indigenous to the district are
  described. The lover of Old World associations will be delighted with the
  industry with which Dr. Johnson has collected, and the care with which he
  has recorded their popular names, and preserved the various bits of folk
  lore associated with those popular names, or their supposed medicinal
  virtues. The antiquary will be gratified by the bits of archæological
  gossip, and the biographical sketches so pleasantly introduced; and the
  general reader with the kindly spirit with which Dr. Johnson will enlist
  him in his company&mdash;</p>

  think the editor would have some difficulty in authenticating many of the

  <p>"This light and pleasant Farina is one of the most excellent,
  nourishing, and restorative remedies, and supersedes, in many cases, all
  kinds of medicines. It is particularly useful in confined habit of body,
  as also diarrh&oelig;a, bowel complaints, affections of the kidneys and
  bladder, such as stone or gravel; inflammatory irritation and cramp of
  the urethra, cramp of the kidneys and bladder, strictures, and
  hemorrhoids. This really invaluable remedy is employed with the most
  satisfactory result, not only in bronchial and pulmonary complaints,
  where irritation and pain are to be removed, but also in pulmonary and
  bronchial consumption, in which it counteracts effectually the
  troublesome cough; and I am enabled with perfect truth to express the
  conviction that Du Barry's Revalenta Arabica is adapted to the cure of
  incipient hectic complaints and consumption.</p>
